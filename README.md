# Pluma
Pluma is a lightweight, fast and easy to use configuration loader for golang. 

If you simply want to load configurations from a file, the environment or from the flags passed via the CLI.
All configurations are stored neatly in a central place to be accessed from anywhere. I can also be used as a makeshift global state manager.

This is still in early drafts, and things are subject to change. I am developing this along with other things and integrating at the same time. Feature requests and submission are welcome in the issues and pull requests tabs respectively.
